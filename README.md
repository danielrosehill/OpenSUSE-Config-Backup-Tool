# OpenSUSE Configuration Backup Utility

## Purpose Statement

A few scripts I'm working on to facilitate backing up configurations on an OpenSUSE desktop (Tumbleweed 15.6),

The objective is to create a unified script that can be run progamatically to create incremental system state backups which are capable of being used programatically during a system restore/reprovisioning.
